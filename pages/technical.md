INSERT INSTRUCTIONS

Below is an explanation of what Dublin Core and text item type elements are used and what standards have been applied to their input.  
### Dublin Core elements  
#### Title - required, 1 value allowed

Examples: Ruth Kramer Wedding Suit, Scott Suddarth Quilt Top


#### Creator - required, multiple values allowed


#### Date - optional, 1 value allowed
This element refers to the date the sewing project was completed, not necessarily the date that the photograph was taken.  For that reason, clothing made for a specific event such as a wedding may have a different year than the event itself.  Likewise, for many of Ruth Kramer's sewing projects, particularly ones she made for herself or ones that she originally intended to sell, the date she made the project may be unknown.
