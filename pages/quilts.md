Ruth Kramer began sewing quilts for her children and grandchildren in the beginning of the twenty-first century.  When she died in 2020, each of the quilts were given to their intended owners or intended owners' parents.  Ruth's oldest grandchild, Kate Suddarth, found some seamstresses who would be able to sew the backings onto the quilt tops in order to make them useable.  She gave them her own quilt as well as Nancy Kramer's with an estiamte of late 2022 for when the quilts will be finished.  If she approves of their work, she intends to commission them to complete other relatives' quilts as well.
